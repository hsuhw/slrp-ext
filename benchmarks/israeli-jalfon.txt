// Israeli-Jalfon self-stabilising protocol (see IJ'90 in our CAV'16 paper for
// more detail)
//
// In a nutshell, this is a routing protocol in a ring-shaped topology, where
// a process may hold a token. When a process holding a token is chosen by the
// scheduler, it will toss a coin and pass the token to the left/right each with
// probability 1/2. When two tokens are held by the same process, they will be
// merged. The initial configurations are configurations holding at least one
// token. The final configurations (a.k.a. *stable* configurations) are those
// where precisely one process is holding a token. The liveness property to
// prove, hence, is that the probability of reaching a stable configuration
// from any initial configuration is 1.
